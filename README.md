# map-toolkit

This is aimed to be a handful of scripts that will be benefitial for compiling and ediitng source engine maps via an instance based workflow.

This is intended to be an alternative to the batch based toolkit that is used on the Garry's Mod Server called Meta Construct
https://github.com/Metastruct/map-compiling-toolkit

Currently this is able to:
* Generate a gameinfo text. (Currently only does MetaConstruct gameinfo generation)

Planned functions:
* Instancing maps to master VMF
* Compiling of VVIS, VRAD and VBSP elements for VMFs
* Hammer Launching into specific configurations

Currently this project is on hold, but may be worked on in the future.
